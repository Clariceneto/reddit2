Just outline what you expect the person to do. How long are the episodes? How long the social media videos are. How much raw footage, how many social media videos, etc...\n\nIf you're not shady, then reword it, because I see red flags everywhere.  \nSure, a lot of people are desperate right now, maybe you aren't a predator. Maybe check out some other job descriptions, word it more professionally, and outline the pay frequency. \n\nIf you are advertising to Californians (which you are by posting in FilmIndustryLA), it's the law that the pay rate is posted in the job description.",
